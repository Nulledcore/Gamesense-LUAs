# x88Cheats v2.0

## What is x88Cheats?
x88Cheats is a LUA that replicates the GUI of MasterLooser's cheat

## Changelog
###### [Version 2.0]
* Rewritten for Gamesense's LUA API

## Note
* I'm actually dumb and can not for the life of me figure out how to check for the things listed in "Needs Fix"
* Also Headshot Only hasn't been implemented yet. I'm still trying to figure out GS's API so give me some time.
* If you would like to help with the LUA just let me know, I'm open to anyone helping perfect this LUA :D
* Also I don't write LUAs so please tell me if there is a more effecient way of doing all these IF Statements..

## Needs Fix
* In Lobby because 'paint' isn't called unless you're in a game. If there's another callback let me know please.
* NoHands doesn't check for hands transparency (don't know how to check the color picker for transparency)
* Chams doesn't change to what cham material is selected (don't know how to check the material combobox)
* MPoints doesn't do check for anything (don't know how to check the multi-select)

## Ideas
* Enable ESP when Dead
* Make all options an actual button rather than just text that displays
* Add Legit and SuperLegit checkbox that loads preset settings and stores the original settings for reverting
